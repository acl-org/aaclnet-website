Such petitions will be reviewed by the Chapter Board; upon a majority vote of the Board in favor of approving the petition, the petitioner will be granted membership for five years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Board
<ul>
<li>The administration of the Chapter shall be conducted by the Chapter Board, which shall consist of a Chair, a Secretary, a Treasurer, a Chair-elect, and three (3) Board members. The person holding the Chair-elect position will become the next Chair. All these persons shall be Chapter Members, and shall be elected by the Chapter Members for a two-year term of office. No more than two members of the Chapter Board are permitted from one country/ territory, except under special circumstances, such as vacancies. If vacancies occur, the Chapter Board shall appoint replacements, subject to approval by the Association Executive Committee, to serve until the next election. Chair and Chair-elect are not allowed to be from the same country/territory. Except for the Treasurer, no Board member shall serve more than two (2) terms in any single elected office, and no more than three (3) terms in any elected office. The Treasurer may serve for a maximum of ten (10) years in that position, subject to the satisfaction of the Board, the Members, and the Association Executive Committee.</li>
<li>In the event that the Chapter be given funds by the ACL Executive to administer separately and independently from the ACL, the Chapter Treasurer is empowered to receive, deposit, and disburse such funds on behalf of the Association and the Chapter in Asia-Pacific and, together with the Chapter Secretary, to make arrangements for handling the affairs of the Association and the Chapter in this region.</li>
<li>The Chapter Board shall: a) determine the place and time of Chapter conferences and meetings; b) appoint members to be responsible for organizing the programs and local arrangements of such conferences and meetings; c) select the editors of any publications prepared for the Chapter; d) appoint members to various positions and form committees to assist in conducting the activities of the Chapter; e) fix registration fees for Chapter meetings; f) select a representative to attend the Association Executive Committee meetings.</li>
<li>All actions taken by the Chapter Board are subject to review at the annual meeting of the Association Executive Committee.</li>
<li>To oversee the elections, there shall be a Nominating Committee consisting of at least three members, who shall each serve a four year term. Retiring members of the Chapter Board who are not re-elected to positions as officers or board members are eligible to become new members of the Nominating Committee. Any member of the Nominating Committee who is elected to the Chapter Board shall stand down from the Committee. If the size of the Nominating Committee falls below three, the requisite number of new members shall be elected by the Members as part of the elections of new officers. Nominating Committee members must be Chapter Members in good standing. The Chair of the Nominating Committee shall be determined by random draw from among the members of the Nominating Committee whose terms are about to expire.</li>
<li>Elections shall be conducted annually as follows: the Nominating Committee shall by the first of September preceding the end of a term of office nominate at least one person who is willing to serve for each position to be filled, including any necessary new Nominating Committee member. The Secretary shall send to the Chapter Members notice of the nominations by September 15, at the same time requesting additional nominations. Additional nominations, supported by at least three Chapter Members, may be submitted by the fifteenth of October. Evidence must be presented that the nominee will serve if elected. All nominees will be given at least two weeks to provide a statement of their vision for AACL. These vision statements will be posted on the web site for viewing by the membership. After the nomination and posting of vision statements, the Secretary will mail a ballot containing the final list of nominees for each position, along with information about the URL containing the vision statements, to the membership. Voting will be performed in a manner specified in the ballot, which manner will be open to all members of the Chapter, secret, verifiable, and overseen by an executive committee member (normally the Secretary) who is not running for office, and who is acceptable to all nominees. Any nominee receiving the most votes cast will be declared elected. Should no candidate receive a majority of the votes cast, subsequent ballots will be held until one candidate receives a majority. Those elected shall take office on the first of January following the vote and serve until succeeded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Financial Management
<ul>
<li>Should the Chapter have funds administered independently from the parent Association, its financial year shall coincide with the financial year of the Association. The Administration will be under the obligation to keep such account of the financial position of the Chapter in accordance with the requirements arising therefrom, and to keep the books, records and other data carriers belonging to the accounts in such way that the rights and obligations of the Chapter can be learned at all times.</li>
<li>Should the Chapter have funds administered independently from the parent Association, the Chapter Treasurer will supply a current balance sheet and a statement of assets and liabilities to the Secretary-Treasurer of the Association quarterly. In addition, once a year, these financial statements will be approved and signed by all members of the Board, and will form part of a report on the activities and operations of the Chapter, which will be distributed to the Chapter Members.</li>
<li>The Board will be under the obligation to keep the books, records and other data carriers mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article for ten years. It will ensure that the data is available during that full period, and can be made readable within a reasonable time.</li>
